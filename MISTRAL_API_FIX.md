# Mistral API Fix

This document describes the fix for the "Mistral key not configured" error.

## Problem
The application was showing a "Mistral key not configured" error because the required environment variables were not properly set up.

## Solution
1. Created a `.env.local` file with the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Added `OPEN_BETA=true` environment variable to enable question recording during open beta
3. Verified the Mistral API key is working correctly using the test script
4. Ensured proper error handling in the Mistral API route

## Files Modified
- `create-env.js`: Script to create the `.env.local` file with the Mistral API key
- `test-mistral.js`: Test script to verify Mistral API connectivity
- `.env.local`: Environment configuration file (not committed to repo for security)

## Verification
The Mistral API key has been verified to be working correctly:
- API key is properly configured
- API is accessible
- Found 68 available models

## Testing
To test the Mistral API integration:
1. Run `node test-mistral.js` to verify API connectivity
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
